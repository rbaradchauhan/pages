  <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong><br>

  <p>
    These terms and conditions apply to the Business Card Scanner app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile
    devices that was created by Pramaasoft (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a commercial service.
  </p><br>

  <p>
    Upon downloading or using the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly
    advised that you read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification,
    or distribution of the Application, any part of the Application, or its trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any
    attempt to extract the source code, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions is
    not permitted. All intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service
    Provider.
  </p><br>

  <p>
    The Service Provider aims to ensure that the Application is useful and efficient. They reserve the right to modify
    the Application or its services at any time. Any changes or charges, if applicable, will be clearly communicated to

  </p><br>

  <p>
    The Application requires user authentication to function. You must log in using supported login providers in order
    to scan business cards, store contact information, and access related features.
  </p><br>

  <p>
    The Application allows users to scan images of business cards, extract contact details, and store the information.
    Scanned data may be saved locally on the device or synchronized with cloud services when the user is logged in. You
    are responsible for ensuring that you have permission to scan and store any personal or business information.
  </p><br>

  <p>
    The Application stores and processes personal data you provide to deliver its core functionality. It is your
    responsibility to keep your device secure. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting
    your device, as doing so may compromise security and prevent the Application from functioning correctly.
